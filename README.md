NP_MINDSET IS DEPRECATED
------------------------

np_mindset hasn't worked correctly in years, and does not work with
the new Mindwave headsets. Not only that, it really shouldn't be an
external, but rather an outside OSC server. Luckily, someone else has
done this work. Anyone looking to use Neurosky headsets in Max or Pd
should check out BrainWaveOSC:
